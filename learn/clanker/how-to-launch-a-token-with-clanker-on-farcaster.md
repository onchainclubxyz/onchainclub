## How to Launch a Token with Clanker on Farcaster

Clanker makes it easy to launch your own token and share it with your community using **Farcaster casts**. Just mention the bot, provide your token details, and Clanker handles the restâ€”no wallet or ETH required!

***

### What You Need Before You Start

1. **A Farcaster Account**
   * Sign up on [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com) or [Supercast](https://supercast.xyz) to get started.
2. **An Idea for Your Token**
   * Think of a **Name** and **Ticker** for your token.
   * Prepare an **image** to make it fun and engaging.

***

### Step 1: Compose Your Cast

To launch your token, post a cast with the following:

* **Token Name** â€“ The name of your token (e.g., "Onchain Club").
* **Token Ticker** â€“ A short symbol for your token (e.g., "ONCHAIN").
* **An Image** â€“ Attach an image that represents your token.
* **Mention Clanker** â€“ Use `@clanker` in your cast.

### Example Cast

Hereâ€™s what your cast should look like:

```
hey @clanker Deploy a token for me

Name: Onchain Club
Ticker: ONCHAIN

use this image (attach an image on the cast)
```

_Attach your tokenâ€™s image to the cast._

### Step 2: Let Clanker Deploy Your Token

Once you post your cast:

1. Clanker processes your token details (Name, Ticker, and Image).
2. It replies with:
   * A confirmation message.
   * A visual card for your token (using the provided image).
   * A **View Token** link to see the token details on-chain.

### What Youâ€™ll See

Clankerâ€™s reply will look like this:

> ðŸŽ‰ _"Certainly. I'll deploy your token now. The market will decide its fate, as it always does. I hope it brings you the speculative joy you seek."_

Your token will include:

* The **image** you attached.
* A **View Token** button linking to deployment details.

### Step 3: Share Your Token

After Clanker deploys your token:

1. Share Clankerâ€™s reply with your community.
2. Encourage others to join the conversation and build excitement!
